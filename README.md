# Hi, I'm Eun Ji Sim 👋

I'm a passionate **public health data scientist**/**biostatistician** with a strong background in cancer epidemiology. I enjoy using data to uncover meaningful insights and develop evidence-based solutions that improve health outcomes for patients, especially with cancer. 

Currently, I work as an **epidemiologist** at the Washington State Department of Health, where I supported the state's COVID-19 response by analyzing surveillance data, generating reports, and providing data-driven insights to guide public health decision-making during the pandemic.

With over five years of experience in statistical programming and real-world health data analysis using R, SAS, and SQL, I specialize in cancer and communicable disease epidemiology. I'm driven by a deep interest in data-informed decision making and interdisciplinary collaboration to address public health challenges.

Let’s connect and make data work for better health!
